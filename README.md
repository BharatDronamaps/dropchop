# Dropchop

**You drop. We chop.**

Dropchop is a browser-based GIS powered by [Mapbox.js](http://mapbox.com/mapbox.js) and [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org). The project currently a proof-of-concept and explores [three hypotheses](https://github.com/cugos/dropchop/wiki/Dropchop-Inspiration):

#### 1. GIS can be data-first, not operation-first.
#### 2. GIS doesn't require a server.
#### 3. GIS is open.

Things are moving very quickly with the project right now. We are still continuing to build out and refactor the architecture of the application. If you want to read more about our decision-making process take a look at some of our meeting notes.
